# Information
A Pokemon Pocket console application to let pokemon player
keep, view, check if they can evolve and evolve their pokemon characters. Each time when
players caught a Pokemon, they can add the pokemon to this Pokemon Pocket program.
The pokemon evolution criteria in this application are the simplified version which means
that it could be different from the actual game that you have played in the Pokemon Go.
The evolution of a pokemon here is based on the number of the same pokemon type that
the player collected.
